# Osint Framework
## What ?

It's the best of all tools, your best friend, not only because it contains all the tools we have worked on but much more !

As its name suggests, it's a framework. It provides a simple web-based interface, which contains a collection of OSINT tools to make your intel and data collection tasks easier. All in the form of a cheat sheet with a cluster structure, very practical considering the amount of information and it's a format more than appreciable.On top of that, it is totally open-source.

The most complicated thing with OSINT is to know where to look and with what, one does not screw with a hammer and one does not nail with a screwdriver. 

This is where the OSINT Framework comes in, it is a tool that will allow you to navigate through a tree of tools and resources to find the right tool for the right job.

## How to use it ?

Nothing could be easier, there are two ways to use this tool, either to target specific information quickly, or to launch your search and investigation of all open sources.

Therefore, in the first case, you can directly find the appropriate tools and in the second, you can browse the whole tree point by point and gather/overlap/sort/filter your information.

You find tools like Shodan, Maltego but also others like Metagoofil for, babe X to search in other languages, searchcode to explore source codes and many others

**NB : Disclaimer**

You will find a category dedicated to the darkweb and to everything that is not indextracted, be careful on the measures to take before exploiting this kind of research
