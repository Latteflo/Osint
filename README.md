# Osint 

This repository is hosting all the notes and tools I have gathered during my OSINT journey on how to properly gather information on a target.

## Passive

Passive Information Gathering is the process of collecting information about a target without having any direct interaction with it. Can be use Google Dorks, Browsing Internet resources, Shodan, Maltego, Osint Framework.

### Tools

 - [Google Dorks](Passove/GoogleDorks.md)
 - [Browsing Internet resources](Passive/InternetResources.md)
 - [Shodan](Passive/Shodan.md)
 - [Maltego](Passive/Maltego.md)
 - [Osint Framework](Passive/OsintFramework.md)

## Active

Active Information Gathering we can gather more information about these targets by actively interacting with them. However, unlike passive information gathering, doing this without authorization can be illegal. Can be use DNS Enumeration, Port Scanning, OS Fingerprinting.

### Tools
1. [Dns Enumeration](Active/dns.md)
2. [Port Scanning](Active/nmap.md)
3. [Vulnerabilities scanning](Active/vulnerabilites-scann.md)
4. [Samba](Active/smb.md)
5. [Smtp](Active/smtp.md)
6. [Http](Active/http.md)
7. [Other](Active/other.md)
